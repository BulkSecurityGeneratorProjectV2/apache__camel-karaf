[[BlueprintMain-BlueprintMain]]
= Blueprint Main

This module is used for running OSGi Blueprint standalone via a main class extended from `camel-main`.

Note this is only recommended for development purposes, as the standalone mode is using a limited simulation
of an OSGi container using Apache Felix Connector. Some OSGi features are not supported in this mode.
